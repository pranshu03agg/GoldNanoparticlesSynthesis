## Introduction
Gold nanoparticles have unique optical, electronic, and thermal properties and are used in various applications in electronics, medicine, and catalysis. This project outlines the synthesis of gold nanoparticles and their characterization using XRD, UV-Visible Spectroscopy, and SEM.

## Materials and Methods

### Materials
- Gold (III) chloride (HAuCl4)
- Sodium citrate
- Distilled water (DI water)
- Hot plate
- Stirring rod

### Procedure
1. **Preparation of 1 mM Gold Chloride Solution:**
    - Calculate the amount of Gold (III) chloride required: 
      \[
      1 \text{ mM} \times 393.88 \text{ g/mol} \times 20 \text{ ml} / 1000 \text{ ml} = 0.008 \text{ g in 20 ml}
      \]
    - Dissolve 0.008 g of Gold (III) chloride in 20 ml of DI water.

2. **Preparation of 1% Sodium Citrate Solution:**
    - Prepare 1% sodium citrate solution by dissolving 1 g of sodium citrate in 100 ml of DI water.

3. **Synthesis of Gold Nanoparticles:**
    - Heat the gold chloride solution to boiling on a hot plate while stirring vigorously.
    - Add 2 ml of the 1% sodium citrate solution to the boiling gold chloride solution.
    - Continue boiling and observe the color change from light yellow to colorless, and finally to dark yellow to wine red, indicating the formation of gold nanoparticles.

## Characterization

### X-Ray Diffraction (XRD)
XRD was used to determine the crystalline structure of the synthesized gold nanoparticles.

### UV-Visible Spectroscopy
UV-Visible Spectroscopy was employed to analyze the optical properties of the gold nanoparticles, particularly their surface plasmon resonance.

### Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)
SEM provided detailed images of the morphology and size distribution of the synthesized gold nanoparticles.

## Results
- **XRD Analysis:**
  - The XRD pattern showed characteristic peaks corresponding to the face-centered cubic (fcc) structure of gold nanoparticles.

- **UV-Visible Spectroscopy:**
  - The UV-Vis spectrum exhibited a peak around 520 nm, indicating the surface plasmon resonance of the gold nanoparticles.

- **SEM Imaging:**
  - SEM images revealed spherical gold nanoparticles with an average size of approximately 20 nm.

## Conclusion
The synthesis of gold nanoparticles was successfully carried out using the Turkevich method, involving the reduction of Gold (III) chloride with sodium citrate. The nanoparticles were characterized by XRD, UV-Visible Spectroscopy, and SEM, confirming their formation, crystalline structure, and size.
